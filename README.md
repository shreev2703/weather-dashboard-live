Why This Project Matters:
Understanding current and forecasted weather conditions is essential for making informed decisions about outdoor activities to protect health and safety. For example:
Exercising, like running or cycling, in extreme heat can lead to heat exhaustion or dehydration.
Dogs and pets are sensitive to hot climates and can suffer heatstroke.
Cold weather exercises increase the risk of muscle injuries and respiratory issues if precautions are not taken.
Air quality fluctuations impact vulnerable populations and outdoor plans.
